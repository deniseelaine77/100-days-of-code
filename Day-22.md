<B>Day 22</b>

I'm going to start logging what I am doing on my 100 Days of Code... part of this is because it is recommended, but also because I intend to start a blog as a more public place to track what I am learning, and what I am doing.  
I woke up this morning early - so I went ahead and got back into the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele on Udemy.  I'm working thru Javascript now.  From what I understand, if I can get good with JS, and I know HTML and CSS, I should be able to do some basic webpages and maybe start making a little money.  Just have to get comfortableputting myself out there.
