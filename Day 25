<b>Day 25</b>

It's the first day of my weekend.  I reviewed some twitter feed that I follow for advice, info.  @stephenmf recommended learning a compiled language before front end and my focus has been front end, thinking that is where you start.  He did tell me before that he recommends C#, and that is what he said in a reply to someone else today.  I signed up for a Udemy course on C#.

I think in order to get the best use of the time I have, I need to treat these topics almost like I am in college and going to different courses during the day and having homework in each one..  so I am going to spend some time on the C# course first this morning to see what is is about.  Then get back to JS with Web Developer Bootcamp and FCC.  

I want to start doing some self-created projects so that I can keep practicing, so that is something else I need to plan for...  maybe come up with some ideas for pages and build them myself... I read/was told to find a site that could use a redesign and do that.  

So many things to do.
